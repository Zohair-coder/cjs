# Literature Review

Sexual violence in the United States is a pervasive issue that has been extensively documented in scholarly research, policy analyses, and legal reviews. Historically, the literature suggests that despite the frequency and gravity of the issue, there is a disproportionate rate of underreporting and low conviction for sexual violence crimes, a gap that has far-reaching implications for victims, the legal system, and society at large.

#### Underreporting of Sexual Violence

A significant body of literature focuses on the underreporting of sexual violence. Studies show that many victims do not report their experiences to law enforcement due to various reasons, including fear of retaliation, belief that the police would not or could not do anything to help, feelings of shame, or a desire to keep the matter private. Furthermore, societal stigma and normalization of certain coercive behaviors contribute to victims' reluctance to classify their experiences as crimes worthy of reporting. The empirical evidence suggests that the actual incidence of sexual violence is considerably higher than what is reflected in official crime statistics, highlighting the crucial role of open data in uncovering the hidden dimensions of this social problem.

#### Conviction Rates and Legal Challenges

The literature also reflects upon the low conviction rates for sexual violence offenses. Researchers have identified numerous factors contributing to this phenomenon, including the requirement of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, which is particularly challenging in cases where the incident lacks witnesses other than the victim and the perpetrator. Additionally, deeply ingrained biases and misconceptions about sexual violence often influence jury decisions, leading to victim-blaming attitudes and skepticism about the credibility of victim testimony. Legal documents and policy papers further elucidate the complex nature of prosecuting these crimes, underscoring the discrepancies between reported cases and successful convictions.

#### Impact on Victims and Society

The ramifications of low reporting and conviction rates extend beyond individual cases, affecting the broader societal perception of sexual violence. Academic journals highlight the psychological trauma and the long-term socio-economic impacts on survivors, noting the importance of systemic change to address these outcomes. The underreporting and low conviction rates contribute to a culture of impunity, exacerbating the trauma for survivors and potentially emboldening perpetrators.

#### The Role of Open Data

The intersection of open data with the issue of sexual violence offers a transformative lens for analysis. By providing access to comprehensive datasets, open data initiatives facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the prevalence, patterns, and contexts of sexual violence. The use of open data in research enables the identification of trends and gaps, informing evidence-based policy and interventions aimed at prevention, support, and legal reform.
