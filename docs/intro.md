# Introduction

Sexual violence in the United States is a critical issue that, unfortunately, remains prevalent in our society (RAINN, n.d.). This troubling phenomenon, which encompasses a range of non-consensual acts, profoundly impacts the lives of countless individuals, affecting their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Despite its severity, sexual violence often remains shrouded in silence and stigma, making it a challenging problem to address. 

The availability of open data presents a unique opportunity to shed light on this hidden crisis. By utilizing data from various sources, we can gain a clearer understanding of the scope and nature of sexual violence in the US. This data not only serves as a powerful tool for awareness but also acts as a foundation for developing effective strategies to combat this issue.

By engaging with this topic through the lens of open data, this project contributes to the broader conversation about sexual violence. It demonstrates how access to reliable data can empower individuals to participate more actively in civil society, fostering a more informed and engaged public. Furthermore, this research can be a stepping stone towards advancing the cause of justice, providing evidence-based recommendations that can guide future policy and research efforts to mitigate sexual violence and support its survivors.
