# Description of the Data

For this analysis, the study leverages data from three prominent sources: the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). These datasets provide a multifaceted view of the incidence and nature of sexual violence in the United States.

#### National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

The NCVS is one of the primary sources of information on criminal victimization in the US and offers a detailed picture of crime incidents, including those not reported to police. Administered by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the NCVS collects data on personal and household victimization through a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The survey encompasses information on the frequency of sexual assault, risk factors, relationship to the perpetrator, and the impact on the victim. Its strength lies in its ability to capture the dark figure of crime, that is, incidents that have not been reported to law enforcement agencies.

#### Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program

The UCR is a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of nearly 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily reporting data on crimes brought to their attention. The FBI compiles the data, which includes reports on rape and sexual assault. The UCR provides data from the law enforcement perspective and is valuable for understanding the extent of sexual violence that enters the criminal justice system. This data is useful for identifying trends over time and for comparison with the NCVS to understand reporting rates.

#### Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) Data

RAINN is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization and operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline. The data provided by RAINN includes statistics on survivors who have sought support, as well as information on the consequences of sexual violence for survivors. RAINN compiles statistics from various sources, including NCVS and UCR, and provides additional context and analysis, particularly around reporting rates and the experiences of survivors post-assault.

#### Authenticity and Validity

The data from these sources are widely recognized as authentic and valid, with each dataset undergoing rigorous methodology and data collection processes overseen by reputable agencies and organizations. The NCVS and UCR are longstanding governmental data collection programs, and their methodologies are public and peer-reviewed. RAINN's data aggregation from various sources provides a holistic view and is often cited in academic and policy discussions.

#### Relevance to the Research

The combined use of these datasets will allow for a comprehensive analysis of sexual violence in the United States. The NCVS data will provide insight into victimization that might not be captured in official police reports, while the UCR will show the extent of sexual violence that is reported to and recorded by law enforcement. RAINN's data will offer additional insights into the support structures for survivors and the social context of sexual violence. Together, these datasets will serve as a solid empirical foundation for the research questions posited in this paper.
