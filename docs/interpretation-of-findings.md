# Interpretation of the findings

The visualizations derived from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) data reveal stark insights into the landscape of sexual violence in the United States. These findings are interpreted to reflect on the broader societal implications and the systemic challenges faced in addressing and mitigating sexual violence.

### Reporting Rates and the Journey to Conviction

The horizontal bar chart, depicting the comparison of reporting rates among different violent crimes, shows that rape and sexual assault have markedly low reporting percentages. With only 23% of such incidents being reported to the police, as indicated by the NCVS, it is evident that sexual violence remains a crime that is largely hidden from the formal justice system. This underreporting is indicative of the various barriers victims face, which range from personal trauma and stigma to systemic distrust and anticipated re-traumatization through the legal process.

The subsequent stages of the justice process, as illuminated by the combined data from NCVS, UCR, and RAINN, show a narrowing funnel leading to conviction. While approximately 20% of reported cases result in an arrest, only about half of these arrests proceed to trial. The grim reality culminates in the finding that, of the cases that do reach trial, only 35% result in a conviction. Collectively, these figures substantiate the assertion that sexual assault is the violent crime least likely to end in conviction in the United States, with less than 1% of incidents leading to this outcome. This portrays a discouraging picture for victims considering coming forward and underscores the necessity for reform in how these cases are handled legally and societally.

### Victimization of Minors

The pie chart detailing victim age demographics from the NCVS emphasizes that a significant proportion of sexual violence victims are minors. This information bears considerable weight, highlighting the critical need for protective measures and specialized support systems for this particularly vulnerable demographic. It underscores the urgent requirement for targeted policies and prevention strategies to safeguard young individuals from such crimes.

### Locations of Assault

The utilization of RAINN's visualization that breaks down the locations where sexual assault occurs provides an intimate understanding of the spaces where victims are most at risk. With over half occurring at or near the victims' homes, it challenges the conventional notion of safety associated with personal dwellings. This suggests that intervention strategies need to extend into the private spheres and communities need to be more actively involved in creating safe environments.

### Perpetrators Known to Victims

The pie chart showing the relationship between victims and perpetrators reveals that an overwhelming majority of perpetrators are known to the victim, disrupting the stereotype of the 'stranger danger' narrative. This finding is crucial for reorienting prevention efforts and educational programs, which must address the complexities of navigating interpersonal relationships and the often-overlooked issue of acquaintance or intimate partner violence.
